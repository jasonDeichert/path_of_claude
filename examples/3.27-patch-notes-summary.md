# Path of Exile 3.27: Keepers of the Flame - Patch Notes Summary

**League Launch:** October 31, 2025

## Major New Features

### 1. Asynchronous Trading System
- **When unlocked:** Act 6 (find Faustus in Lioneye's Watch)
- **How it works:** Place items in Merchant's Tabs for instant purchase by other players even when offline
- **In-game Trade Market:** Full trade website functionality integrated into the game client
- **Impact:** Massive QoL for trading, especially valuable in SSF-adjacent playstyles

### 2. Ten New Bloodline Ascendancy Classes
- Secondary Ascendancy classes providing additional passives
- Unlock by defeating specific bosses
- Grants additional power to you or your skills
- **Strategic consideration:** Need to research which bosses and which Bloodlines synergize with build plans

### 3. New Skill Gems
**Confirmed new skills:**
- Kinetic Rain
- Kinetic Fusillade
- Wall of Force
- Conflagration
- Thunderstorm
- Somatic Shell

**Analysis needed:** Which of these are league-start viable? Which scale well on low gear?

## Core Mechanic: Breach Rework

- Breachlords establishing constructs across Wraeclast
- **Genesis Tree:** New progression system for growing rewards
- **Grafts:** New item type that can be "fused to player's body"
- Full Breach rework as core league mechanic
- **Consideration:** Breach encounters during leveling, potential early currency/items

## Major Balance Changes

### Defensive Nerfs
- **Spell Suppression:** Now prevents 40% damage (down from 50%)
  - **Impact:** Significant nerf to right-side builds
  - **Strategy:** May need more investment in other defensive layers
  - **Classes affected:** Rangers, Shadows especially

### Minion Changes
- **Minion Attacks now inherently always Hit**
  - **Impact:** Potentially huge buff to minion accuracy
  - **Strategy:** May free up passive/gear investment previously needed for minion accuracy

### Ascendancy Reworks
**Major reworks confirmed:**
- Assassin
- Trickster
- Champion

**Action item:** Need full ascendancy changes to evaluate build viability

## Quality of Life

- **Bestiary Orbs:** No longer required to itemize beasts
  - Can itemize directly from Bestiary UI in Menagerie
  - Minor but nice for beast trading/storage

## League Challenges
- 40 new challenges
- Exclusive rewards
- Standard, Hardcore, and Solo Self-Found variations

## Information Gaps (Need to Fill)

1. **Full patch notes:** Need complete skill gem balance changes
2. **Atlas changes:** Full atlas passive tree modifications
3. **New unique items:** Complete list with stats
4. **Bloodline details:** Which bosses, which passives, unlock requirements
5. **Breach mechanic details:** Reward structure, difficulty curve
6. **Graft system:** How it works, what benefits, how to acquire

## Strategic Implications for HC SSF League Start

### Nerfs to Consider
- Spell suppression nerf = right-side builds need more defensive investment
- Need to see full patch notes for other defensive changes

### Buffs to Consider
- Minion accuracy = potential minion build viability increase
- New skills = potential sleeper meta builds

### New Mechanics
- Bloodline ascendancies = possible power spike at specific progression points
- Breach rework = need to understand if this helps or hurts leveling speed
- Grafts = unknown power level, could be build-enabling

### HC SSF Priorities
1. **Tanky league starter** (especially with spell supp nerf)
2. **Doesn't rely on uniques** (SSF constraint)
3. **Good with Bloodline power spike** (if accessible early)
4. **Can handle Breach encounters** (core mechanic)
5. **Scales well into endgame** (HC SSF = slow progression)

## Next Steps

- [ ] Get full patch notes (skill gem numbers, complete ascendancy changes)
- [ ] Research Bloodline ascendancy details
- [ ] Analyze new skill gems for league start viability
- [ ] Get HC SSF build data from previous league (what worked)
- [ ] Identify builds that survive spell suppression nerf
- [ ] Test new skills in practice league if possible
